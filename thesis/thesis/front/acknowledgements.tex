\miniheading{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my adviser Patrick Lam for his encouragement, patience, and guidance throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies.

Next I would like to thank Jeff Zarnett for providing me with previous students' assignment code and marks. I would not have been able to finish my analysis without his invaluable test data.

I would also like to thank my reading committee for taking the time to read my thesis and make suggestions for improvements.

Last but not least, I would to thank my colleague Jon Eyolfson for helping me debug my program and teaching me the various nuances of Clang and the LLVM infrastructure.
