\section{Summary}

One common pattern we observe is the tradeoff between number of automated assignments and false positives. The more assignments that we want to automate, the more false positives we will get. 

The choice of algorithm is ultimately a decision for the user to make: if we want to prioritize saving time, then we should use Gaussian Mixture; conversely, if we want to prioritize minimizing the number of false positives, then we should use K-Means or Minimum Distance.
