\section{Always Full Marks}
\label{sec:ctm-full-marks}

Since we expected most of the class to receive full marks for the assignment, we used the trivial approach of always giving everyone full marks as our baseline to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of our other approaches. Any other marking technique must perform better than this \textquote{automatic} technique to be considered an improvement over manual marking.
