\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}

\item We presented a novel approach to automatically mark programming assignments

\item We demonstrated promising potential in using Gaussian Mixture clustering to aggregate AST TED into a final score
\begin{itemize}
\item Automate up to 70\% of assignments
\item Up to 21\% false positive rate vs. 35\% baseline
\end{itemize}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item In summary, we've presented a novel approach to automatically mark programming assignments
\item We have demonstrated promising potential in using Gaussian Mixture clusting to aggregate AST edit distance into a final score
\item We've shown this can automate up to 70\% of the assignments with 21\% false positive rate, which is slightly better than our 35\% baseline
\item However, this is still too high to be usable in a live classroom. While no student would complain about getting more marks than they should have, a high false positive rate diminishes the value of assignments.
\end{itemize}
